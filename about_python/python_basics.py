# Definition
# Python is a high level programing language, it used to give the instruction to the computer to perform specific task.

# History
# Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989
# Python version 1.0 released in 1991
# Python version 2.0 released in 2000
# Python version 3.0 released in 2008

# Why pyhon was popular
# Python was free and open source (we can optimize based on our requirements)
# Python is powerful object-oriented programing language(if we create anything is an object in python)
# Python easy to read, write and understand(less syntax so we can more concentrate on logic)
# Python come with a rich built-in library(it reduce the programmer time)
# Python is system independent language(we can execute same code in any operating system)
# Python is dynamic programing language(No need to specify data type automatically binds to appropriate data type during
# run time)
# Python is an interpreted language(Line by line execution)

# Compilation
# source_code.py -----> Python compiler---->byte_code.pyc-----> Pyton virtual machine -------> out put

# Identifier
# Name given to the different programing competes like class name, function name, variable name, object name, module

# Rules to create identifier
# Identifiers name can start with alphabet or _
# It can contain alphanumeric value but not start with number
# Special character not allowed except _
# Keywords cannot be used as identifier

# Keywords
# Special words in python they have specific meaning to it, they are reserved words.
# They are case-sensitive

# Keywords in python
# and - logical operation
# as - to create alias
# assert - for debugging
# break - to break out of the loop
# class - to define a class
# continue - continue to next iteration of a loop
# def - define a function
