# Definition
# Python is a high level programing language, it used to give the instruction to the computer to perform specific task.

# History
# Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989
# Python version 1.0 released in 1991
# Python version 2.0 released in 2000
# Python version 3.0 released in 2008

# Why pyhon was popular
# Python was free and open source (we can optimize based on our requirements)
# Python is powerful object-oriented programing language(if we create anything is an object in python)
# Python easy to read, write and understand(less syntax so we can more concentrate on logic)
# Python come with a rich built-in library(it reduce the programmer time)
# Python is system independent language(we can execute same code in any operating system)
# Python is dynamic programing language(No need to specify data type automatically binds to appropriate data type during
# run time)
# Python is an interpreted language(Line by line execution)

# Compilation
# source_code.py -----> Python compiler---->byte_code.pyc-----> Pyton virtual machine -------> out put

# Identifier
# Name given to the different programing competes like class name, function name, variable name, object name, module

# Rules to create identifier
# Identifiers name can start with alphabet or _
# It can contain alphanumeric value but not start with number
# Special character not allowed except _
# Keywords cannot be used as identifier

# Keywords
# Special words in python they have specific meaning to it, they are reserved words.
# They are case-sensitive

# Keywords in python
# and - logical operation
# as - to create alias
# assert - for debugging
# break - to break out of the loop
# class - to define a class
# continue - continue to next iteration of a loop
# def - define a function
# del - delete object
# elif - to make a condition statement
# else - to make a condition statement
# except - used in exception handling
# False - boolean value
# finally - used in exception handling
# for - create loop
# from - import specific part of the module
# global - to declare the global variable
# if - to make a condition statement
# import - import specific module
# in - used to check value present in iterable
# is - used to check varietals are equal
# lambda - create an anonymous function
# None - represent the null value
# nonlocal - to declare a nonlocal variable
# not - logical operator
# or - logical operator
# pass - function without implementation or null statements
# raise - to raise an exception
# return -to exit the function and return a value
# True - boolean value
# try - exception handling
# while - to create a loop
# with - exception handling
# yield - return a list of value from the generator


# Variable
# name given to the memory location and which holds the actual value.
# value can be changed at any time
