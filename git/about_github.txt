# GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git.
# It allows you to Host Git repositories online, Share your code with others, Contribute to open-source and Collaborate on projects

#  Key Features of GitHub
# Repositories (Repos)
# A repo is your project folder on GitHub.
# It holds your code, commits, issues, and history.
# Can be public (anyone can see) or private (you control access).

#  Commits & History
# Represents a snapshot of your code.
# Has a message like “Added login page”.
# Is saved with author name, date, and hash.

#  Branches
# Branches let you work on features independently from main.
# You can test, edit, or break code without affecting the original.

# Pull Requests (PRs)
# A pull request is how you ask to merge changes from one branch/repo to another.
# Team members review, discuss, and approve the changes before merging.
# Great for collaboration and quality control.

# Forking
# Fork = copy someone else's repo into your account.
# Make changes without affecting the original.

# Issues
# Issues = To-do list + bug tracker
# Used to report bugs, request features, or manage tasks.
# You can assign labels, assignees, milestones, etc.

# GitHub Actions
# Running tests when code is pushed
